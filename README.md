Understood! Here are the possibilities for the function `generateCaseSensitiveHex`:

1. **Default (4 characters):**
   ```
   62^4 = 14,776,336
   ```
   This means you can generate up to 14,776,336 unique keys with 4 characters.

2. **6 characters:**
   ```
   62^6 = 56,800,235,584
   ```
   With 6 characters, you can generate up to 56,800,235,584 unique keys.

3. **8 characters:**
   ```
   62^8 = 218,340,105,584,896
   ```
   For 8 characters, the number of unique keys increases to 218,340,105,584,896.

4. **10 characters:**
   ```
   62^{10} = 8,631,762,020,291,600
   ```
   Finally, with 10 characters, you can generate up to 8,631,762,020,291,600 unique keys.

# Considerations

- we're planning to add separators but this can add two unneccary space
